          <span className='faq-page-subtitle'>What is DOE CODE?</span>
          <br/>
          <p>DOE CODE is a software submission and search tool that allows for scientific software to be provided to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). DOE CODE provides functionality for collaboration, archiving, and discovery of scientific software. DOE CODE replaces the Energy Science and Technology Software Center (ESTSC). DOE CODE is an open source project and is available on GitHub. Throughout these FAQs, the terms "software" and "code" are used interchangeably.

          <br/>
          <span className='faq-page-subtitle'>What does it mean for DOE CODE to be released in Alpha?</span>
          <br/>
          <p>In Alpha, DOE CODE supports submission of unlimited distribution software projects, code repository services, and search and discovery of published software projects. As development of DOE CODE continues in toward Beta and Production releases, additional features and functionality will be included. Future requirements will include provenance and version tracking, social coding features, and additional profile features.</p>

          <span className='faq-page-subtitle'>What are the types of Software Availability?</span>
          <br/>
          <p>
            <strong>Open Source, publicly available repository</strong>
            - Software that can be freely accessed, used, changed and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone in a public repository. Open Source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition. See Open Source Initiative for more information and definitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Open Source, no publicly available repository</strong>
            - Code is Open Source, but is not yet available in a public repository. Interested users can contact the developer(s) or responsibly parties for information regarding access and (re)use. A landing page URL is required for submitting Open Source, no publicly available repository, the URL is typically a landing page where interested parties can find out more information about obtaining access to the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Closed Source</strong>
            - Software that is not Open Source and for which access must be granted by contacting a licensing official. Software is often Close Source because it is proprietary, sensitive, or has otherwise been deemed necessary for a limited distribution. A landing page URL is required for submitting Closed Source code, the URL should provide interested parties additional information on how they can obtain access to the code.</p>

          <span className='faq-page-subtitle'>Are there restrictions on the use of the material in DOE CODE?</span>

          <span className='faq-page-subtitle'>How is Software Submitted?</span>
          <br/>
          <p>Individual software records are directly submitted by the developer or the developing organization.  Metadata information about software can be submitted to OSTI through DOE CODE.</p>
          <p>DOE CODE offers two paths for users to provide code. Users can (1) <strong>publish</strong> code to DOE CODE, and (2) <strong>submit</strong> code to the Department of Energy for official review and release through DOE CODE. See the "How do I publish code to DOE CODE?" and "How do I submit code to the Department of Energy through DOE CODE?" for more details.</p>
          <br/>
          <span className='faq-page-subtitle'>How do I publish code to DOE CODE?</span>
          <br/>
          <p>Users may want to publish their code to DOE CODE. Publishing to DOE CODE is easy, with only a minimal set of metadata required. Publishing offers increased discoverability and the option to obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the code, making it more easily citable and shared.  Codes in early development, along with those wanting to obtain DOIs early in the process, are the primary use case for this functionality.  (See more information about DOIs, below)</p>
